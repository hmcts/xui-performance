# XUI Gatling Performance Tests

This script runs a suite of services against XUI in a cohabitation scenario:
- General caseworker flows
- Financial Remedy solicitor journey
- Family Public Law solicitor journey
- Immigration and Asylum solicitor journey
- No Fault Divorce solicitor journey
- Private Law C100 solicitor journey
- Private Law FL401 solicitor journey
- Probate solicitor journey

To run locally:
- Performance test against the perftest environment: `./gradlew gatlingRun`

Flags:
- Debug (single-user mode): `-Ddebug=on e.g. ./gradlew gatlingRun -Ddebug=on`
- Run against AAT: `Denv=aat e.g. ./gradlew gatlingRun -Denv=aat`

Before running locally, update the client secret in src/gatling/resources/application.conf then run `git update-index --assume-unchanged src/gatling/resources/application.conf` to ensure the changes aren't pushed to github.

To make other configuration changes to the file, first run `git update-index --no-assume-unchanged src/gatling/resources/application.conf`, ensuring to remove the client secret before pushing to origin

## ðŸ”— Submodules

The XUI-Performance repo now utilises calls from the [common-performance](https://github.com/hmcts/common-performance) repo, using the XUIHelper file.

Please ensure that you have pulled the latest master from this repo and check that the common-performance repo has been added under 'common' in the project root dir.
If it has not been added, following the [Setup Instructions](https://github.com/hmcts/common-performance/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-setup-instructions)

#### Note - This will also need doing the first time you run this from one of the VMs too!
